## Basic KQL Syntax and Operations

### Overview of KQL Syntax

Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a powerful language used for analyzing and extracting insights from data, particularly in security and threat hunting scenarios. The syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it accessible for users with various levels of programming experience.

### Key Characteristics of KQL Syntax

- **Case Insensitivity**: KQL is case-insensitive for keywords, operator names, and function names.
- **Tabular Data Format**: KQL queries operate on tabular data (tables) and return results in table format.
- **Piping**: Uses the pipe character (`|`) to pass the results of one command as the input to the next.
- **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

### Common KQL Commands and Operators

#### 1. `search`
- Used for free-text search across all tables.
- Example: `search "error 404"`

#### 2. `where`
- Filters rows based on the specified condition.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4625`

#### 3. `project`
- Selects which columns to display in the results.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | project AccountName, EventID`

#### 4. `summarize`
- Aggregates data based on specified grouping.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | summarize count() by EventID`

#### 5. `join`
- Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- Example:
```kql
SecurityEvent
| join Heartbeat on Computer
| where EventID == "4688"
| project Computer, OSType, OSMajorVersion, Version

#### 6. `extend`
- Creates new columns by calculating values from existing columns.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | extend NewColumn = AccountName + "_suffix"`

#### 7. `top`
- Returns the first N records sorted by a given expression.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | top 10 by TimeGenerated`

#### 8. `sort`
- Sorts the rows in the table based on specified columns.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | sort by EventID desc`

#### 9. `count`
- Returns the count of rows.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | count`

#### 10. `distinct`
- Returns unique rows.
- Example: `SecurityEvent | distinct AccountName`

## Data Schema in KQL

### Understanding the Data Schema in the Context of KQL

Kusto Query Language (KQL) is designed to work with data in Azure Data Explorer, which is highly structured. Understanding the data schema is crucial for formulating effective queries and extracting meaningful insights.

#### What is a Data Schema?

- A data schema in KQL defines the structure of data in a database. It includes the organization of data as tables and columns and defines how data is stored, accessed, and managed.

#### Characteristics of KQL Data Schema

- **Tables**: In KQL, data is organized into tables. Each table is similar to a table in a relational database and represents a specific type of data or log.
- **Columns**: Each table consists of columns, where each column has a specific data type, like string, integer, datetime, etc.
- **Data Types**: KQL supports various data types, including but not limited to strings, integers, datetime, and complex types like arrays and dictionaries.

### How Data is Structured in KQL Queries

#### Basic Structure

- KQL queries operate on these tables and columns. The basic structure of a KQL query involves specifying the table to query and then applying various transformations and filters, like `where`, `project`, and `summarize`.

#### Example Structure

```kql
TableName
| where ColumnName == "Value"
| project Column1, Column2
| summarize Count() by Column1
